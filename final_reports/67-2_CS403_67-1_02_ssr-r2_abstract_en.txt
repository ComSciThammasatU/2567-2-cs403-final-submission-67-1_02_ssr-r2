SCI BAND MUSIC PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
ระบบจัดการงานแสดงของชุมนุมดนตรี คณะวิทยาศาสตร์และเทคโนโลยี

                  ABSTRACT
	This project involves the development of a music performance 
management system for the SCI BAND club under the Faculty of Science and 
Technology, Thammasat University, Rangsit Campus. The primary issues addressed 
include disorganized communication within multiple LINE chat groups and confusion 
caused by last-minute performer swaps during live events, which often disrupted the 
order of performances. 
	To solve these problems, a mobile application was developed using 
React Native, NestJS, and PostgreSQL. The system facilitates the management of 
member information, performance order, song queues, and real-time notifications via 
Discord on the event day. 
	The system emphasizes organized performance scheduling and 
structured data management, enabling members and organizers to monitor event 
progress in real-time. It also supports integration with Google Sheets, which stores 
data from Google Forms used for club registration, allowing the system to restrict 
access exclusively to active SCI BAND members. Furthermore, the system includes 
functionality to deactivate accounts for members who have graduated. 
	This system enhances the overall efficiency of SCI BAND's event 
management, contributing to smoother and more professional musical performances. 
It reduces confusion stemming from poor communication, improves stakeholder 
satisfaction—including members, event organizers, and audiences—and fosters 
effective collaboration within the club’s team.
